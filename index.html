                    <p>
                        Hi! My name is Camilla, and I‚Äôm a 2nd semester Web Development (PBA) student at Zealand,
                        Roskilde. Before starting this PBA, I finished as a Multimedia Designer from Copenhagen
                        School of Design and Technology (KEA) in Summer 2020.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This page is a compilation of projects that display what I‚Äôve learned through my education,
                        mainly from the Multimedia Designer education. As you might see from my projects, I am very
                        focused on coding, though I have acquired a wide range of skills, with everything between
                        design, marketing and coding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I especially enjoy the programming part with JavaScript and have created my last few projects
                        in Vue.js.

                            <p>
                                For my final exam on KEA, I chose to create a new website for the company BEMY. BEMY
                                sells personalised gifts, and I wanted to create a website where the user would be able
                                to builds complete gifts, e.g. for their bridesmaids, in a system that would keep each
                                gift separate, instead of just shoving all products into one cart.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This project was made in Vue.js with Shopify Storefront API as back end. It took a lot
                                of work to make everything work together, since the user would have many possibilities
                                on the website; selecting different options for their products, writing texts
                                themselves, creating separate gifts, duplicating gifts etc. It became a complex system,
                                but I believe I managed to get all features I wanted into the website.

                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                This was the exam project for our 3rd semester subject, Front End Development. The
                                assignment was to create a landing page for a gaming/gambling website, with a game to
                                catch the user‚Äôs attention.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My main area in this project has been the programming of the game itself in the middle
                                of the website (I haven‚Äôt made any graphics on the site). This is a slots game, of which
                                the purpose is that the player can win coins to use on the ‚Äúreal‚Äù money based games
                                after creating a user.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This had two big parts to it; the visual side, where the ‚Äúwheels‚Äù had to look realistic
                                and spin well; and the back end of the machine, where it should be able to hold wheels,
                                check if the player has won etc. With all this, I have made it very dynamic so it is
                                easy to add another wheel, change the symbols on each wheel etc.
                            </p>

                                The goal of this project was to create an interactive timeline of some sort. In my group,
                                we chose to make a timeline over deaths in the Death Note anime.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My group member did the graphics, drawings and handwriting animations. I worked mainly
                                on the ‚Äúinteractive‚Äù parts of the timeline; making the names show up as you scroll by
                                them, making the lines proportionate to the time passed since last death, placing
                                everything correctly on the ‚Äúpages‚Äù etc.

                                This website was made for the client, Florist Lars Jon Flower Studio, as part of my 2.
                                semester group exam. The project itself was an all-around project, including market
                                analysis, user testing, video editing and building the website from scratch. I have made
                                big parts of both the design and the website itself, which is based on WordPress Rest
                                API as back end.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In terms of design, we wanted to create a ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù design to balance the website in an
                                industry that is considered very feminine.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As for the website itself, we were very focused on making the website as dynamic as
                                possible, making it possible for the client to both add and remove content without
                                having to go into the code.

                                The focus of this solo project was to further my JavaScript skills. While I had already
                                worked with loops, templates and filtering/sorting i JavaScript, this student list
                                needed more ways of filtering, updating statuses of the students, adding additional
                                information from a seperate json and several more tweaks that made the final list. Other
                                than just meeting the requirements of the assignment, I also used this as an opportunity
                                to practice separation of concerns, splitting the code into more functions and properly
                                return functions.

                                This solo project was all about making a game, and it was my first time working with both
                                Illustrator and JavaScript. While I didn‚Äôt focus much on the animations in the game, I
                                was very focused on making the game work as supposed, including the points, timer and
                                ‚Äúlives‚Äù in the game. I also spend a lot of time on the illustrations, making sure that
                                the design is consistent and fits the mood of the game.

                                our idea generation, we wanted to focus on talking about tough topics, and use that as a

                                sketching and coding. The only thing I did not touch was the final graphics of the game.

                            <p>
                                This was our first project focusing on a functional website for a real client.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The project had two main parts; first off, we did a lot of user testing and card sorting,
                                to be able to make a better and more user friendly interface. Then we created the
                                website with WordPress Rest API as back end, trying to also make it as user friendly as
                                possible for the admins behind it that would use it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the group project, I was focusing on the code and wrote most of it. My own personal
                                focus was especially making it ad dynamic as possible, so that the user would be able to
                                create and remove content without having to go into the code itself.

                                For this solo project, I was going to create the logo, design and website for a made-up
                                restaurant. This project was much about the design- and testing-process, but it was also
                                the first time I really tried working with json-files and CSS grid.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For this website, I also made my first attempt at a WordPress version with a standard
                                theme. This was only done on a single day and didn‚Äôt exactly match my original site, but
                                I did get a little experience with WordPress.

                                This portfolio was made as part of my 1st semester exam. It
                                displays all the projects I made through the 1st semester, and the website itself is
                                made with many of the skills I had learned at the time. I especially focused on various
                                CSS and JavaScript-effects I hadn‚Äôt tried out before, including modal windows, and hover
                                effects showing more information. I also focused on the site to be responsive, both in
                                terms of screen size, but also whether the device is a mouse- or touch-device, which
                                would change the hover effect.

                                current website is pink and very flashy, which we wanted to keep, but with a more
                                user-friendly design.

                                I wrote most of the code for this website, which was made only with HTML and CSS, and
                                mainly flexbox. It was one of my first projects, so the result is quite limited, though
                                we did end up with something acceptable. Other than the website itself, we also made the
                                video presented on the website and have also taken most of the images ourselves.

                                written one article for them, which is what I link to here.

                                I have also worked as a secretary in a law firm in Oxford, UK (Family First Solicitors),
                                where I was mainly transcribing from dictations. This means that I am fluent in both
                                Danish and English and generally have a wide experience in different areas of writing.

                                organisation promoting traffic safety. The campaign was to be focused on 60+ cyclists,
                                and our group chose to focus on remembering to wear a helmet. We named our campaign
                                ‚ÄúRemember your crown‚Äù.

                                analysed the data given by the organisation. Other parts of the project included making
                                graphics and interactive elements (in our case, a quiz) for a potential website, and
                                social media content.

                                In this project, we were asked to come up with an idea for an app that would make life
                                easier for students. We decided to create an app where students could ask for help with
                                school projects, where they would both be in queue to get help from a teacher, and at
                                the same time be able to get help from other students.
                            </p>

                                This project was very time limited, and so there was only make an XD-prototype. The
                                focus was to find out which functionalities would be necessary, and how things should be
                                structured for all students to be able to get the most out of the app.

                                (our school platform). This project was split in two; in the first part, we worked alone
                                with a large portion of user testing, site map for the current site etc. In the second
                                part, we worked together as a group, still with focus on UX and creating a better
                                interface that could fix the problems we found in our research phase.

                                I have been very interested in photography and editing in my free time. I especially
                                enjoy photography with models, though I also have some experience with both events and
                                products.
                            </p>

                                I know my way around a DSLR, and have also taken a course in photography at a Production
                                School, mainly focused on products and the editing process of those.
